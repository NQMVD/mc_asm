# Explanation

Here's a work in progress rewrite in Rust.

**Why?** Two reasons:
1. i don't like python*
2. i want it to be a proper, standalone, all-in-one command line tool that you just download and use

**The Roadmap:**
- [x] 1-to-1 assembler in rust
- [ ] `.schem` file generator
- [ ] cli tool with subcommands
- [ ] `.litematic` file generator
- [ ] assembler rewrite in *actual, idiomatic* rust

**Disclaimer:**
I'm not an expert... in any part of this.
I used the YT series to get a better understanding of how computers work on the physical level and i still don't fully understand it. I hope writing an assembler for it helps lol.

Also not an expert in Rust either, but i know enough to make cool cli programs with it.
I frequently consult my good friend over at OpenAI




= im not an expert, had help from chatgpt

Technical view:
using clap, custom errors, mc_schem crate




\* = i hate it, lua is better, planned lua code, more
